description: Summarize the active Maestro session without mutating state
---


# Maestro Status

Call `get_skill_content` with resources: ["architecture"].


## Workflow

1. Read the active session using MCP state tools if available; otherwise fall back to scripts or direct file read
2. Report session ID, creation timestamp, workflow mode, and overall status
3. Show phase breakdown: completed phases with timestamps, current active phase, pending phases, and failed phases with error summaries
4. Report file manifest (files created, modified, deleted), token usage by agent, and unresolved errors

## Constraints

- This is read-only; do not mutate state, archive sessions, or continue execution
- If no active session exists, say so plainly
